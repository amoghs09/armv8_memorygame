# ARMv8 Emulator, Assembler and Memory Game

In this project we have developed an emulator and assembler for a subset of the ARMv8 AArch64 instruction set, written entirely in C. As an extension, we created a memory training game on a Raspberry Pi.

⚠️ **Please note:** The source code for the emulator and assembler cannot be displayed publicly as it is part of university coursework. It is available upon request. This repository therefore provides **full documentation**, and the source code for our **memory game only**
